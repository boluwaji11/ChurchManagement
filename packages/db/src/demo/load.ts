 * R19.7. A demo church, loadable and removable.
 *
 * Time to value is the metric this serves. A church that signs up sees an empty
 * list and has no way to tell whether the product suits them without first
 * doing the work of importing. This fills it in one press and empties it in
 * another.
 *
 * Every id written is recorded, so removing is exact rather than a guess from
 * names or dates. Removal is a real delete, which is the one place the
 * archive rule does not apply: these are not the church's records, and a demo
 * you cannot get rid of is worse than no demo.
